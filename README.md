# Day-12-Python

Project 12 on my path to learn python   
To demo the file go to https://replit.com/@david07adekeye/Day-12-Python and type the command streamlit run streamlit_app.py in the terminal  
or press run and go the the second preview that is generated without the 3000 port (only if the url you have has a 3000 port)  
if you have a better suggestion on how to demo this please tell me
